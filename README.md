# Home Manager Unified

## Permanent family database

The app can synchronize its complete structured state through a shared Firebase Firestore vault. Create a vault under **Settings → App & data**, then share the generated link only with trusted family members. The same link works from Firebase Hosting, GitHub Pages, other browsers, and other devices. Changes are cached locally for offline use and synchronize when connectivity returns; if two devices edit the same data simultaneously, the most recent document save wins.

Vault access uses Firebase Anonymous Authentication plus an unguessable 256-bit key in the shared URL. Firestore rules prevent listing vaults and reject access outside the exact keyed state document. Structured settings and family records are synchronized. Passwords, passcodes, secrets, OTPs, credential fields, OAuth tokens, raw SMS backup files, and textbook PDF files are not uploaded.

Firebase project setup is declared in `firebase.json` and `firestore.rules`. Anonymous Authentication must remain enabled for the `home-manager-2026` project.

One dependency-free application combining the meaningful capabilities from all repositories under `GuruKulaDesam` and `shishyan`.

## Product structure

Daily and weekly work is organised into seven plain-language groups: **Today, Household, Family, Money, Care, Learning, and Community**. No group exposes more than seven choices. The active group opens its pages directly in the main sidebar. Permanent or rarely changed preferences use only three Settings groups: household profile, people and roles, and app and data.

Family now has seven owned workflows: overview, shared calendar, travel, celebrations, documents, contacts, and protection and legacy. Care also has seven: overview, health, medicines, appointments, elder care, emergency, and pets. Medicine, appointment and elder-care entries have their own registers, owners, due dates and section-owned costs; the Care overview consolidates the next handoff without pretending to diagnose, send dose alarms or contact a clinician.

Today projects recurring work into one agenda. Operational sections own every financial input: vehicle insurance and fuel stay in Vehicles, health insurance and care costs stay in Health, groceries stay in Food, education fees stay in Learning, and utilities, loans and subscriptions stay with Property. **Money is reporting-only** and consolidates Budget, Cash flow, Spending, Commitments, Net worth and Reports. Emergency help remains available from the right utility rail and links to official Indian helplines without claiming to dispatch assistance.

Tasks, events, issues, contacts and recognition use shared context-aware data instead of duplicate stores. The colorful interface uses seven accessible icon and tab tones over twelve locally stored mountain photographs, with highly translucent operational surfaces, alternating table bands and no dark register banners.

The command center includes a seven-item date-sorted agenda, overdue and low-stock signals, current-month finance totals, seven-day study focus, notifications, icon-triggered context-aware search, route-aware header KPIs, expandable sidebar page navigation, combined filters, calendar month navigation, mobile agenda views, keyboard-accessible study status controls, core record editing, undo for deletions, persistent appearance preferences, validated backup import, seven action Quick Add and responsive navigation. The top identity row and right utility rail have no shell background, leaving the selected mountain photograph visible. Data is stored locally in the browser under the versioned `home-manager-unified-v1` key.

## CBSE learning suite

Learning provides seven pages for CBSE students in Classes 6-12: Dashboard, Books & Curriculum, Planner, Assignments, Assessments, Practice and Reports. The supplied household starts with separate Class 7 and Class 12 profiles. Each child has an independent subject list, mastery record, weekly study plan, school work, scheduled exams, completed results, question-practice log, error notebook and parent review. The Class 12 workflow records theory and practical, project or internal evidence separately; the middle-stage workflow combines outcomes, application questions, projects and school feedback.

Books & Curriculum includes separate current-book catalogs for the Class 7 and Class 12 profiles. A family member can add a lawfully obtained PDF to the browser, read it without leaving Home Manager, resume by page, set bookmarks, record page-specific review notes and mark a book reviewed. PDF files are stored in browser IndexedDB, are never uploaded and are deliberately excluded from JSON backups; reading progress, bookmarks and notes remain in the ordinary Home Manager backup. Each title also links to its official NCERT catalog or the Peepal portal. Home Manager does not copy or redistribute NCERT files because NCERT's textbook terms prohibit republication in other software without permission.

The curriculum and resource links are based on the official [CBSE 2026-27 curriculum](https://cbseacademic.nic.in/curriculum_2027.html), [CBSE competency-based education](https://cbseacademic.nic.in/cbe/index.html), [CBSE assessment resources](https://cbseacademic.nic.in/cbe/assessment.html), [Class XII 2025-26 sample papers and marking schemes](https://cbseacademic.nic.in/sqp_classxii_2025-26.html), and [NCERT textbooks](https://ncert.nic.in/textbook.php). School subject combinations, textbook editions, internal-assessment rules and exam dates remain editable because the school and current CBSE circulars are authoritative.

Readiness is a planning indicator built from recorded curriculum mastery, completed assessments and practice accuracy. It excludes scheduled exams and is not an official grade prediction. Where no assessment or practice exists, it uses the recorded curriculum mastery instead of assigning a false zero. The parent report identifies support priorities while explicitly discouraging sibling comparison and punitive use of marks.

### Peepal Prodigy integration

Both learner profiles are connected to Peepal Prodigy School in Coimbatore. The Dashboard includes the verified CBSE affiliation number `1930782`, school campus contact, official programme page and parent portal. The Class 7 profile follows the published Grades 6-10 secondary approach; the Class 12 profile records the published G1A-compatible subject set of English, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and Computer Science. The app does not claim a tutor assignment, current fee, calendar date or attendance value unless the family enters it from a confirmed school source.

The seven Learning pages now also cover a confirmed school timetable, school calendar, attendance, daily student self-assessment, Student-Parent-Tutor review actions and co-curricular growth. These match Peepal's published emphasis on interdisciplinary and peer learning, hands-on application, learning skills, student-led review, physical education, clubs and activities. School-owned information links to the [Peepal secondary programme](https://www.peepalprodigy.in/secondary-school.html), [senior secondary subject groups](https://www.peepalprodigy.in/senior-secondary-school.html), [parent portal](https://crm.peepalprodigy.cloud/), [mandatory disclosure](https://www.peepalprodigy.in/images/saras.pdf), and the official [CBSE SARAS affiliation record](https://saras.cbse.gov.in/SARAS/AffiliatedList/AfflicationDetails/1930782).


## Profile-Driven Navigation & 3-Level Study Progress

### Profile-driven navigation auto-reset
Switching family profiles on the top bar automatically resets the sidebar navigation to match each member's primary focus:
- **Mom (Thamarai Elangovan):** Automatically switches to **Food & Kitchen** (`kitchen/overview`).
- **Father (Nagarajan Balasubramanian):** Automatically switches to **Finance & Reporting** (`home/finance`).
- **Kids (Sasha & Ishaan Nagarajan):** Automatically switches to **Education** (`study/student-overview`), strictly scoped to Class 12 for Sasha and Class 7 for Ishaan.
- **Family (Everyone):** Switches to the main **Home Overview** (`global/overview`), displaying all shared household operations.

### 3-Level Proficiency Progress Tracking
Curriculum progress tracking explicitly divides chapter mastery into three distinct levels to prevent confusion:
- **Level 1: Learning** (Initial concept understanding)
- **Level 2: Revision** (Reinforcement and recall)
- **Level 3: Expert** (100% confidence & mastery)

The progress grid header dynamically tracks the active level currently being updated (e.g., `PROGRESS (LEVEL 1: LEARNING)`), and each chapter's output badge tags the exact level being recorded.

### Clean & Clutter-Free UI
- **Top Bar:** Clutter-free layout containing strictly the Family Member profile tabs for instant switching.
- **Left-Aligned Sidebar:** Borderless, minimalist menu items with highlighted group headers for clear visual hierarchy.

## Product question audit

Help & Guide checks 250 unique questions that family members commonly ask about the software itself: its purpose, navigation, adding and updating records, everyday workflows, family roles and safety, privacy and recovery, accessibility, feedback and known boundaries. The questions are organised into seven usability areas and seven family roles. Each answer opens the working destination, starts the relevant capture workflow, or states an unsupported capability directly.

The audit is available from the permanent sidebar Help & Guide action and under Today. Product answers also appear beside household records in global search, with results capped at seven. A seven-step path connects the command centre, family setup, responsibilities, calendar, money, care and backup without requiring the user to understand the internal data model.

The workflows follow shared calendar, meal, shopping and household-list patterns documented by FamilyWall, Cozi and AnyList; cleaning routines documented by Tody; and assigned family tasks, recurring dates and reminders documented by Todoist. Money uses planning and reporting patterns documented by YNAB, Monarch and Quicken Simplifi: fixed, flexible and non-monthly plans, goals, recurring commitments, cash flow, watchlists and net worth. Emergency help links to official Indian services. Home Manager does not claim bank feeds, background reminders, live location, realtime collaboration, access control or emergency dispatch.

The Care suite follows the multi-profile medication, refill, appointment and health-diary workflow documented by [MyTherapy](https://www.mytherapyapp.com/), while keeping this static app to planning records only. It links out to the official [ORS patient portal](https://ors.gov.in/) for supported government-hospital appointments, [Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission](https://abdm.gov.in/) for ABHA services, and the official [Emergency Response Support System](https://112.gov.in/) for Pan-India emergency help. Sensitive medical reports, full ABHA numbers and prescriptions should not be stored in this browser.

## Household coverage

Reusable records cover health, identity documents, bills, insurance, tax, property, vehicles, domestic help, subscriptions, travel and pilgrimage, festivals, emergency planning, pets, digital assets, sustainability, and nominations and legacy. Each area supports adding, editing, deleting, filtering and status tracking, with upcoming dates surfaced on Today and in notifications.

The supplied `Family_Home_Manager_7x7x7_Unlock_Model.xlsx` informed this separation. Stable household identity, people, consent, sync preferences, appearance, privacy and backup map to Settings. Assets, records, plans, actions, collaboration, safeguards and insights map to the seven operational groups. Maturity stages remain a design model, not navigation labels.

The interaction model also draws on 1Password Families for separating private, shared and recovery information. These are adapted interaction patterns, not copied source code or branding. Indian safety and record links point to official ERSS 112, ABHA and DigiLocker services.

Reference fields are intended for masked hints only, such as `ending 1234`. Do not store full Aadhaar or PAN numbers, passwords, banking credentials, medical scans or other secrets. Browser local storage is convenient and private to the device profile, but it is not encrypted. Use the JSON backup controls deliberately and store exported files securely.

Open `index.html` directly or publish the repository root with GitHub Pages. No framework, package installation, server or build step is required.

## Source provenance

- Household lineage: `GuruKulaDesam/Home-Manager`, `Divine-Nest`, `DivineNest`, `ShivohM`, and `shishyan/kovaipudur1c`.
- Community lineage: `GuruKulaDesam/Kovaipudur-Edition`, `shishyan/Kovaipudur`, `kovaipudur1a`, and `kovaipudur1b`.
- Study lineage: `shishyan/ProdyJEE`.
- `KMS`, `NammaOorunga`, and `Zysham` contained no application source, so they add no separate product module.

## Static limitations

Firebase/realtime collaboration, server authentication, background notifications, bank or UPI feeds, government portals, medical systems, payments, municipal APIs and native services require backends or native runtimes. The static application does not claim those integrations are connected. Community votes, registrations, ticket updates and Life Registry records are explicitly local to the current browser.

App & data Settings connects four family Google accounts directly through Google Identity Services: separate family-member mapping and owner consent, Google account selection, verified email identity, Calendar/Gmail/Drive preferences, manual sync and a shared approval queue. Inbox Intelligence turns retained Gmail subject, sender and snippet metadata into local metrics, seven decision categories, urgency and action-date signals, account and sender summaries, trends, and complete filterable history; Money and Learning reports reuse the relevant evidence. No OAuth connector or backend is required. Access tokens remain only in memory and disappear on refresh; the repository and browser storage contain no Google tokens or client secrets. Setup requires only a public OAuth web client ID and is documented in [docs/google-browser-setup.md](docs/google-browser-setup.md). Gmail read-only access remains a restricted Google scope and must meet Google's verification requirements before public production use.

Phone SMS integration includes a private downloadable Android companion under **Settings → App & data**. The companion reads consented inbox messages locally, rejects OTPs, masks long identifiers, deduplicates messages and atomically writes structured Bills, Travel, Appointments, Documents, Study events or Tasks into the shared Firebase vault. Raw SMS bodies stay on the phone. Android SMS Backup & Restore-style XML or structured JSON import remains available as a browser-only fallback.
